## Challenges Faced

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Learning Chrome Extensions
**Problem:** I had no prior experience with Chrome extensions, so I had to learn how they work, including the manifest.json file, background scripts, and popup UI.

**Solution:** I used online resources, documentation, and LLMs (like ChatGPT) to understand the basics and implement the extension.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sending Emails
**Problem:** I wanted to send weekly emails to users but didn‚Äôt know how to integrate an email API.

**Solution:** I used SendGrid to handle email sending. I learned how to use their API and integrated it into the extension.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues
**Problem:** The extension failed to load due to CSP errors, especially when trying to load external resources like Google Fonts.

**Solution:** I updated the manifest.json file to include the correct CSP directives, allowing secure resources like https://fonts.googleapis.com.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Time Tracking Logic
**Problem:** Implementing accurate time tracking for focused vs. distracted websites was challenging.

**Solution:** I used Chrome's `tabs.onUpdated` API to track website visits and categorized them based on predefined lists.
